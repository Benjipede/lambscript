Lambscript
A practical functional scripting language.

Do you hate types? Do you love lambda calculus?
Do you love write things in reverse?

Then you are going to LOVE lambScript!

Ex:
A simple addition
> 1 2 add;
3

A simple if statement;
> ("False") ("True") 4 5 ;
("True")

An (almost) simple implementation of foldr;
> foldr = \f b xs ~ b (\b ~ (xs head) (xs tail $ b f foldr) f) id xs null;
None
> (1 2 3 nil cons $$ cons$$ cons) 0 add foldr;
<Integer(6)>


To run interactively:
pull
./interpreter.py prelude.ls

(you can replace prelude.ls with you own prelude file if you want)

Enjoy amazing coding!
